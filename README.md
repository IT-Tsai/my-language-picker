## My language picker

##### Overview

This project is a personal side project built using Next.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the server side, and MySQL as the database. It is currently in development and is not intended for production use.

- [Frontend] - The frontend is developed with Next.js, a React framework that offers server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for improved SEO, faster page loads, and a dynamic user experience.

- [Backend] - The server side is powered by Spring Boot, a Java-based framework that simplifies the creation of production-ready applications, providing features like dependency injection, embedded servers, and RESTful APIs.

- [Database] - The application uses MySQL as the database management system to store and manage data securely and efficiently. Spring Boot interacts with the MySQL database to handle all data-related operations.
